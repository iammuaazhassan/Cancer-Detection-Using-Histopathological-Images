# Cancer-Detection-Using-Histopathological-Images
Built and trained a simple CNN using TensorFlow/Keras to classify breast cancer histopathological images. Implemented image preprocessing (resizing to 128x128, normalization), trained for 10 epochs, and evaluated using accuracy and loss. Additionally explored transfer learning with VGG16 for improved performance.
